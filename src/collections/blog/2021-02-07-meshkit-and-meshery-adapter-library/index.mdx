The Meshery v0.5.0 release includes two new libraries: Meshkit and Meshery Adapter Library. 

These two libraries improve developer experience and development speed, allowing developers to focus on creating differentiating value, 
instead of having to implement much of the required and inevitable plumbing. 

### meshkit provides functionality useful in all Meshery code.

Meshkit has been around for a while, it was formerly named `gokit`. In this release, meshkit has seen some substantial enhancements, 
a few of which will be discussed in this article. 

The meshkit library provides functionality useful in all Meshery code. It is intended to be one of the top level libraries in the Meshery code ecosystem.
 

It is to be included in all Meshery libraries. It is a toolkit for layer5’s microservices. 
Its purpose is to also provide implementations for common cross cutting concerns like error handling, logging, and tracing. 
It provides models common to many Meshery functionality, like smi conformance and k8s kubeconfig.
Common error handling and logging across xyz is important for unified observability, monitoring and troubleshooting
it leverages other libraries like go-kit/kit. will become layer5’s middleware component for Layer5’s microservices.
another important component is the utils package.
it provides a kubernets and helm client providing functionality on a higher level than the client-go libraried, making it very easy to apply a kubernets manifest to a cluster, or deploy a helm chart.
for instance, the following code can be used to deploy a manifest to a kubernetes cluster, as is e.g. used in mesheryctl.
The following simple example illustrates how nginx deployment manifest is applied to the cluster.

Meshkit library contains code that is useful for most if not all Meshery applications.
helps unified approach, e.g. one log format, consistent errors, implements utilities like kubernetes or helm client low level non trivial. if you wonder how to, have a look.

Programmatically deploy a manifest to a Kubernetes cluster. 
Similarly, meshkit provides an easy way to install a Helm chart.

it can’t get much simpler than this.
it doesn’t get much simpler than that.
note all error handling code is not shown here:

```go
package main

import (
	"os"

	mkitlogger "github.com/layer5io/meshkit/logger"
	mkitkube "github.com/layer5io/meshkit/utils/kubernetes"
	"k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes"
)

func main() {
	// nginx contains the deployment manifest for nginx.
	nginx := `apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
`

	// Create an instance of the meshkit logger handler, providing standardized output format.
	log, err := mkitlogger.New("ExampleApp", mkitlogger.Options{Format: mkitlogger.JsonLogFormat, DebugLevel: false})
	if err != nil {
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	log.Info("Successfully instantiated meshkit logger")

	// Detect the kubeconfig on the local system.
	config, err := mkitkube.DetectKubeConfig()
	if err != nil {
		log.Error(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	log.Info(config.Host)

	// Create Kubernetes client set for the detected kubeconfig. 'kubernetes' is from the Kubernetes Go client.
	clientset, err := kubernetes.NewForConfig(config)
	if err != nil {
		log.Error(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	// Create an instance of the meshkit Kubernetes client ...
	client, err := mkitkube.New(clientset, *config)
	if err != nil {
		log.Error(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	// ... and use it to deploy nginx to the cluster.
	err2 := client.ApplyManifest([]byte(nginx), mkitkube.ApplyOptions{
		Namespace: "default",
		Update:    true,
		Delete:    false,
	})

	if err2 != nil {
		log.Error(err2)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```

### Meshery Adapter Library 

> Meshery adapters manage the lifecycle of service meshes.

Meshery adapters are management plane components and manage the lifecycle of service meshes. 
This includes installation and deletion, configuration, verification that an installation follows recommended practices. 

In addition, Meshery adapters can verify whether a service mesh complies to SMI, the service mesh interface standard. 

Adapters include also sample applications that can be deployed for easy and quick exploration of service mesh capabilities.

The Meshery Adapter Library contains code common to all adapters, reducing the amount of boilerplate code substantially and 
making adapter code easier to follow.

All Meshery adapters are packaged as Docker images and expose the same gRPC API:

<img src={meshServiceServer} class="image-center" alt="mesh service server grpc" />

Each Meshery adapter is packaged as a Docker image. All Meshery adapters implement the same gRPC API. 
This makes it easy to add new adapters to Meshery, and is one of the extension points of Meshery.

> Meshery adapters abstract away the differences in how service meshes are installed and configured.

Meshery adapters abstract away the differences in how service meshes are installed and configured. 
For instance, some service meshes have their own installer, like `istioctl` for Istio, while others use Helm charts, like Consul. 

from point of view of caller, information about the service mesh and adapter, name and version.

Meshery frontend is not supposed to know anything about the adapters, except how to reach their endpoint. Meshery adapter no state (almost)
list of operations is what the user of adapters is interested in
operation is eg installing a service mesh, installing a sample application, running an smi conformance test.
All Meshery adapters implement the same gRPC service interface. It provides five functions:
 
 * CreateMeshInstance: 
 * MeshName: returns the name of the mesh
 * ApplyOperation
 * SupportedOperations: returns a list of operations
 * StreamEvents:
  
All Meshery adapters implement the same gRPC service interface. 
A Meshery adapter is a gRPC server that exposes this interface. 
The Meshery frontend running in a browser is sending requests to the Meshery backend which in turn acts as a client of 
Meshery adapters, using this interface. (For a detailed discussion, see xyz). 
Another client is for instance the tool gRPCurl that is used in tests to verify functionality of an adapter. 

The gRPC interface exposes these functions (and more are likely to follow): 

<img src={meshServiceServer} class="image-center" alt="mesh service server grpc" />

As can be expected, adapters for the various meshes have a lot of code in common. 

Initially, the common code was copied from one adapter implementation to the next. 

The question arose whether common code should be factored out to one or several common libraries. 

This is of course a common scenario, and advantages and disadvantages of common libraries have been discussed extensively in the history of programming. 
This community has discussed it as well, and concluded that it provides value. 
For one, as there is less code in each adapter, it is easier to get an overview and understand what is happening. 
This is especially valuable in an open source community where typically many developers contribute, for varying amounts of time.
For the same reasons, it is important that libraries are easy to understand.  

 
For the other, new adapters can be implemented quickly. 
In principle, what needs to be implemented is configuration and operations that differ between the meshes. 
It is important that common libraries implement good and easy to understand abstractions. 
It is useful that they implement all the boring and repetitive stuff, the ‘plumbing’. 
Common libraries should provide default implementations which can easily be replaced. 
For this, well defined extension points should be declared. This is of course implemented using interfaces.
  
The Meshery Adapter Library provides a common and consistent set of functionality that Meshery adapters use for 
managing the lifecycle, configuration, operation, and performance of service meshes and their workloads.

The initial code commit was submitted on October 6th 2020 based on a refactoring effort in the adapter for the Kuma service mesh. 
Within a few months, several adapters have been refactored or implemented from scratch based on this common library.

The main purpose of the meshery-adapter-library is to
* provide a set of interfaces, some with default implementations, to be used and extended by adapters.
* implement common cross cutting concerns like logging, error handling, and tracing.
* provide a mini framework implementing the gRPC server that allows plugging in the mesh specific configuration and operations implemented in the adapters.

The library consists of interfaces and default implementations for the main and common functionality of an adapter. 
It also provides a mini-framework that runs the gRPC adapter service, calling the functions of handlers injected by the adapter code. 
This is represented in an UML-ish style in the figure below. 

The gRPC service is set up, instantiated and started in the main package of each adapter.

In turn, concrete handlers with the default implementation from the library, or an adapter specific implementation 
realised by extending default implementation, loading adapter specific configuration, and implementing adapter specific operations.

The main component is of course the adapter handler, that implements the adapter interface. 
The default implementation in the library implements all functions except `ApplyOperation`, where a no-op function is provided. 
This makes the architecture more explicit and helps leverage IDE support for the code as seen in this screenshot from intellij:


<img src={adapterHandlerInterface} class="image-center" alt="adapter handler interface" />

Also, using interfaces like that has another advantage: chained, wrapped, delegated. middleware. intercepting. e.g. logging all calls.
